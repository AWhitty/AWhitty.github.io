          During the summer of 2014, I designed and built the <a href="#">Sphero Partners</a> portal and store to help Sphero expand their reach with resellers and education partners. Since its launch a month ago, the application has processed over $12,000 in sales and over 70 partner applications.

        <h2>Design challenge</h2>
        <!-- <p class="text-lead">Sphero, as a connected toy company, works with a host of distributors and resellers to get its products to market. Because Sphero is a still young and small company, it lacks the employees to closely manage partnerships with many potential resellers, distributors, and educators. When I started my internship at the beginning of the summer, Sphero's partner application form was brimming with applicants.</p> -->

        <p class="text-lead">Sphero works with a host of distributors and resellers to get its devices in front of as many faces and on as many shelves as possible. Since Sphero is still a young and growing company, it lacks the employees to closely manage partnerships with many smaller distributors and resellers. When I started my internship at the beginning of the summer, Sphero was passing up many opportunities to work with partners due to the logistical nightmare of bringing on a new partner. <mark>My task was to streamline the application and review processes and to develop an automated system for handling bulk orders of Sphero's products.</mark></p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <h3>Inputs</h3>

        <p>For this project, I spent quite a bit of time analyzing the order flow around McMaster-Carr's impressively organized online catalog and Amazon's frictionless 1-Click process. My goal from the start of the project was to meld the two disparate use-cases into an output that felt both industrial and human-centered.</p>

        <a href="{{ "/assets/images/work/sphero/mcmaster-carr.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/work/sphero/mcmaster-carr.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" class="img-responsive"></a>
        <p>From the very start, you feel like a pro using the McMaster shop. You don't just create an order, you <em>build</em> it, even if you're only buying a couple screws. </p>

        <p>Amazon's 1-Click button is dangerously simple. You don't have to think about any details around your order, only that you want the product you're looking at and you want it now.</p>

        <h3>Prototypes</h3>
        <p class="pad-bottom">I spent about two weeks working full time on prototypes of the interface. In this time period, I explored many alternate options for each interaction before honing in on the options that I felt would be the most practical and efficient. During this period, I also spent time getting acquianted with Sphero's bulk order process for existing partners and pinpointing which parts could be automated and which would require human intervention.</p>

        <p class="pad-top">I initially envisioned a dashboard for tracking every step of an order. I later realized the use case would be a lot simpler and that most customers would only manage one or two orders at a time.</p>

        <p class="pad-top">We eventually chose to simplify the payment options to only debit and credit cards in the interest of scability, but I spent some time exploring how a customer might keep track of multiple forms of payments on multiple orders.</p>
