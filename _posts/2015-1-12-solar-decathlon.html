          In 2013, I worked with the Stanford Solar Decathlon Team to realize a Web-based iPad application for home automation, real-time resource monitoring, and goal setting. My roles on the project ranged from the high-level concept design down to the nitty-gritty implementation details of channeling streams of sensor data into meaningful visualizations.

        <h2>Design challenge</h2>

            <p class="text-lead pad-top">
              Stanford's entry in the 2013 Solar Decathlon, branded <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/features/2014/starthome/">Start.Home</a>, featured a Core module that housed all of the sophisticated electrical components and most appliances within the house. Inside the Core, a few <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">small computers</a> processed data from many sensors throughout the house. <mark>My team's task was to take these streams of data and present them to the residents of the house in meaningful and actionable views while providing direct control over the connected components in the house (lights, fans, windows, etc.).</mark></p>





        <h2>Process</h2>

        <h3>Inputs</h3>

        <p>For this project, I spent quite a bit of time analyzing the order flow around McMaster-Carr's impressively organized online catalog and Amazon's frictionless 1-Click process. My goal from the start of the project was to meld the two disparate use-cases into an output that felt both industrial and human-centered.</p>

        <a href="{{ "/assets/images/work/sphero/mcmaster-carr.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/work/sphero/mcmaster-carr.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" class="img-responsive"></a>
        <p>From the very start, you feel like a pro using the McMaster shop. You don't just create an order, you <em>build</em> it, even if you're only buying a couple screws. </p>

        <p>Amazon's 1-Click button is dangerously simple. You don't have to think about any details around your order, only that you want the product you're looking at and you want it now.</p>

        <h3>Prototypes</h3>
        <p class="pad-bottom">I spent about two weeks working full time on prototypes of the interface. In this time period, I explored many alternate options for each interaction before honing in on the options that I felt would be the most practical and efficient. During this period, I also spent time getting acquianted with Sphero's bulk order process for existing partners and pinpointing which parts could be automated and which would require human intervention.</p>

        <p class="pad-top">I initially envisioned a dashboard for tracking every step of an order. I later realized the use case would be a lot simpler and that most customers would only manage one or two orders at a time.</p>

        <p class="pad-top">We eventually chose to simplify the payment options to only debit and credit cards in the interest of scability, but I spent some time exploring how a customer might keep track of multiple forms of payments on multiple orders.</p>
