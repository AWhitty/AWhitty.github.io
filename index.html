          <strong><a href="https://partners.gosphero.com">Sphero Partners</a></strong>, work</a>
          <p>I designed and built the Sphero Partners portal and store to help Sphero expand their reach with resellers and education partners.</p>

          <strong>Zephyr Racing</strong>, school
          <p>Working with a team of 5 for <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs210/">CS210</a>, I helped build an interface to meld a traditional lap timer experience with computer analysis of the racetrack.</p>

        <li>
          <strong><a href="/keychord/">Keychord</a></strong>, school
          <p>I built Keychord to prototype a velocity-sensitive QWERTY keyboard for making music on a regular desktop. Through this project, I developed an inexpensive technique to turn most dome-switch keyboards into expressive and familiar musical instruments.</p>

          <strong>Cocktail graph</strong>
          <p>In my neverending quest to make the perfect cocktail, I have been scraping ebooks to build a graph of (so far 3,000) cocktail recipes and their ingredients. I can't publish the dataset due to copyright, but I intend to share a summary eventually. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/emOZ8Ln.png">Here's</a> an example of the data processed with a community clustering algorithm.</p>

        <li>
          <strong>Rhyme prediction</strong>
          <p>I think we can all agree that Google's autocompletion is pretty spot-on most of the time. But what if it could rhyme? I'm implementing a modified version of the a rhyme detection algorithm described in <a href="http://www.bradleybuda.com/rhymes/595-final-report.pdf">this paper</a> to quickly predict rhymes in context.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pimiento</strong>
          <p>Pimiento is an RGB LED controller I devloped for the Raspberry Pi with an interface built using Ionic. I also soldered together a small circuit to bridge the RPi and the LED strips. Really, I broke the original IR-compatible controller while examining it and had to build out a new way to turn the lights on.</p>
          <p>This was a fun project from my sophomore year. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lafyzR5_DHY">very blurry demo</a>.</p>

      <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      <p>My body requires a blend of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Witty-er">music</a>, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/102625">bicycles</a>, <a href="http://www.pabloscoffee.com" title="Best coffee shop in the world.">coffee</a>, and Rice Krispies cereal to operate. I come from the suburbs of Denver, Colorado and require a fresh dose of mountain air about once a month.</p>
      <p>I study computers at Stanford University and work to make lives better through careful application of technology. I care about accessibility, affordability, and sustainability.</p>
